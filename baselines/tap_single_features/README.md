# TAP Single Features Baseline

Individual TAP features used as direct predictors for specific properties.

## Description

This baseline uses correlations between individual TAP features and biophysical properties to generate simple predictions. Each TAP feature is mapped to one or more properties based on observed correlations (â‰¥0.2).

### Feature Mappings

- **PNC** (Negative Patch Charge)
  - AC-SINS_pH7.4 (negative correlation)
  - PR_CHO (negative correlation)

- **SFvCSP** (Structural Fv Charge Symmetry Parameter)
  - AC-SINS_pH7.4 (positive correlation)
  - PR_CHO (positive correlation)
  - HIC (negative correlation)

- **PPC** (Positive Patch Charge)
  - AC-SINS_pH7.4 (positive correlation)
  - Titer (positive correlation)

- **CDR Length**
  - AC-SINS_pH7.4 (negative correlation)
  - HIC (positive correlation)

## Requirements

- Pre-computed TAP features in `../../features/processed_features/`
  - `GDPa1/TAP.csv`
  - `heldout_test/TAP.csv`

## Installation

```bash
# From this directory
pixi install
```

## Usage

### Generate Predictions

```bash
pixi run predict
```

This creates multiple prediction files (one per TAP feature) in:
- `../../predictions/GDPa1/TAP/`
- `../../predictions/heldout_test/TAP/`

### Development

```bash
# Run tests
pixi run test

# Lint code
pixi run lint
```

## Output

Generates 4 prediction files per dataset:
- `TAP - PNC.csv`
- `TAP - SFvCSP.csv`
- `TAP - PPC.csv`
- `TAP - CDR Length.csv`

Each file contains predictions only for the properties that correlate with that feature.

## Notes

This is a simple baseline that demonstrates feature-property relationships. More sophisticated models (like `tap_linear`) combine multiple features for better predictions.
